# XboxOneDigitalDumper
A set of python scripts to dump digital Xbox One (and possibly series) software. 
Currently, the main script accepts unmodified `.22c21d21-1f1b-46b5-916a-a0d690ae61e1` files , parses the URL's in them, downloads and hashes the files. 
The progress reporting is broken, ignore it.
